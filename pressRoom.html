                <p>Our mission at the Stomach Cancer Relief Network is to provide the person living with stomach cancer (gastric cancer), or the caregiver of the victim, some financial relief with a one-time grant to assist with any financial burdens that one incurs during this already difficult time.</p>

                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>Our vision at the Stomach Cancer Relief Network is to bring more awareness of the disease to the community by education, more research, and to live in a world where stomach cancer is no longer taking lives and destroying families.</p>

        <div class = "history">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Within 4 months after giving birth to her son Noah on March 7, 2007, Yanira Mitchell found out she was already in stage IV of Stomach Cancer and had only 6 months to live. The pregnancy had masked the stomach cancer the whole time. Yanira, Marcus, and Noah's world was never the same again. After just a couple of days, Yanira and Marcus accepted the diagnosis, but not the prognosis. They decided if this cancer would be the ultimate thing that would take her life away, they would fight together, and do whatever was necessary to prolong her life since she had so much to live for. On the first day of chemotheraphy while Yanira slept, Marcus prayed for direction in what good God would like them to do from all of this. In that instant, a vision was given to Marcus to what needed to be done. It became so clear because their finances were ruined and money was always tight to do just the easiest tasks like putting gas in a car, paying a phone bill, etc., etc. They both made a pact that as soon as she recovered, or if she passed away that this financial help given to others through a non-profit organization could assist the person with stomach cancer or the caregiver. Despite having radiation treatments, chemotheraphy, and her entire stomach removed, Yanira died in a hospice on September 6, 2008 at the age of 38 yrs. old. After months of detachment from the world, Marcus reentered the world of the living through social media. In April 2009, Marcus adapted the screen name <a href = "https://twitter.com/GuyNSinCity" target="_blank">GuyNSinCity</a> on Twitter and started doing pay it forward with anything he had personally as well as fincially. 19 months later, Marcus got refocused on his true mission and Stomach Cancer Relief Network Inc. was born on November 22, 2010.</p>

        <h1>Marcus Mitchell</h1><br>
        <h3>(CEO/President/Founder)</h3><br>
        <p>Marcus Mitchell was born on December 4, 1970 in Washington, D.C. After graduating high school in 1988, the 17 yr. old went to work right away at the Central Intelligence Agency. He made a 10 yr. career at the CIA with this opportunity. Throughout this time, he acquired a diploma at Tesst Electronic Computer Institue, but often felt there was something missing. Also during this time he got married for the first time and had a daughter, but things didn't work out, and they later divorced. Marcus relocated to Las Vegas where he began a new career in the logistics field at Exel which is where he met Yanira, fell in love, and would stay for 7 yrs. until her death from stomach cancer. Marcus resigned with great respect and honor from all his colleagues in September 2008. Now armed with passion and a mission, Marcus sets out to help change the world and inspire people through his twitter account. In November 2010, Marcus calls together some close assosicates to be a part of the non-profit organizaion he and Yanira invisioned. On November 22, 2010 the dream finally became a reality for Stomach Cancer Relief Network Inc.</p>
